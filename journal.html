<h3>
	Journal Entry #3
</h3>
	I worked on my 1st proper animation. I used what I had from the first couple classes to make the background have a transitioning color. Then I took a image and cut it out from the background so it would just be the subject. I put that into my github folder and then made that the background image to put it over the changing background. 

	p.s. thx molly for the help cutting the image out!
